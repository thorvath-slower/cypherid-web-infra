# D2 (CZID-26 C1): split the single CI/CD role into two least-privilege roles.
#
#   czid-dev-gh-actions-plan  — READ-ONLY. Assumable from any branch/tag/env
#     (the module's C1 :pull_request deny still applies). Gets AWS-managed
#     ReadOnlyAccess plus a scoped terraform-state READ policy. Used by the
#     `plan` workflow so a plan can render a diff but can never mutate AWS.
#
#   czid-dev-gh-actions-apply — WRITE. Assumable ONLY from refs/heads/main
#     (subject_ref_pattern), so only a merge to main can apply. Keeps the full
#     existing czid_ci_cd deploy policy plus a scoped terraform-state READ/WRITE
#     policy, and the three previously-over-broad managed policies replaced with
#     scoped inline equivalents (D4). Used by the `apply` workflow.
#
# NOTE (workflow follow-up): plan_component_call.yml / apply_component_call.yml
# currently both assume `czid-${env}-gh-actions-executor`. After this applies,
# repoint the plan job to `czid-${env}-gh-actions-plan` and the apply job to
# `czid-${env}-gh-actions-apply`. The old executor role is intentionally kept
# in place until the workflows are cut over, then removed in a follow-up.
