# =============================================================================
# Dedicated Karpenter NodePool for seqtoid-web (#486), codified (not kubectl-applied).
#
# The module's DEFAULT NodePool floors instance-cpu > 8 (>=16-vCPU nodes) and only
# consolidates empty nodes after 24h — wasteful for a small dev app and slow to give
# the node back on the weekend cost spin-down. This pool:
#   * labels its nodes `seqtoid.io/pool=web` so the chart's nodeSelector lands here,
#   * allows SMALL amd64 nodes (instance-cpu < 9, e.g. a 2-vCPU c6a.large),
#   * consolidates fast (1m) so a suspend->0 actually frees the node quickly.
# amd64-only because the seqtoid-web image is single-arch amd64 (multi-arch is #482).
#
# Managed as a kubectl_manifest for consistency with the module's own default
# NodePool/EC2NodeClass (also kubectl_manifest). Reuses the module's `default`
# EC2NodeClass (correct subnet/SG/AMI discovery for czid-dev-eks-v2). Applied after
# the cluster exists (depends on the module's karpenter CRDs + nodeclass).
