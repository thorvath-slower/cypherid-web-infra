# =============================================================================
# Dedicated Karpenter NodePool for per-PR preview sandboxes (#607c/#617).
#
# Previews run on their OWN pool (seqtoid.io/pool=preview), SEPARATE from the app pool
# (nodepool-seqtoid-web.tf), for two reasons:
#   * COST CAP: this pool has `limits` (total cpu/memory). Karpenter refuses to launch
#     more nodes once the cap is hit, so unbounded preview fan-out (many open labelled
#     PRs) can never run away with spend -- excess sandbox pods just stay Pending. The
#     app pool has no such cap and must not be squeezed by previews.
#   * ISOLATION: preview pods never share a node with the live dev app.
#
# Small amd64 spot nodes (previews are ephemeral + interruption-tolerant); fast
# consolidation; a short node expireAfter so recycled preview capacity is reclaimed.
# Reuses the module's `default` EC2NodeClass (same subnet/SG/AMI discovery as the web
# pool). Additive kubectl_manifest; apply with -target.
