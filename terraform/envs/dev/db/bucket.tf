# The inline `acl`, `acceleration_status`, `versioning`,
# `server_side_encryption_configuration`, `lifecycle_rule`, and `cors_rule`
# sub-arguments of `aws_s3_bucket` were deprecated in the AWS provider v4 and
# moved to dedicated `aws_s3_bucket_*` resources (removed in a future major).
# They are split out below (#475). Splitting an inline block into its standalone
# resource is apply-safe: the bucket is not recreated, so no `moved {}` blocks
# are required. `versioning` on `samples` was already externalized to
# `aws_s3_bucket_versioning.samples`, so the (conflicting, superseded) inline
# `versioning { enabled = false }` is simply dropped rather than duplicated.

# The aws_s3_bucket_acl "private" resources for samples / samples_v1 were REMOVED: S3 disables
# ACLs by default (ObjectOwnership = BucketOwnerEnforced) since April 2023, so PutBucketAcl now
# fails outright (400 InvalidArgument) and took the whole db stack's apply down. A "private"
# canned ACL was always a no-op on these buckets -- they are private by default and access is
# governed by the bucket policy / IAM. Same fix as ecs/aegea-ecs-execute. See #687.
