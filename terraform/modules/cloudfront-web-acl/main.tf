# CZID-356 (#356): CLOUDFRONT-scoped WAFv2 Web ACL for the platform's CloudFront distributions.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE MODULE FROM web-acl-regional-v3.3.1:
# CloudFront requires a Web ACL with scope = CLOUDFRONT that lives in us-east-1 (a GLOBAL ACL). That is
# a DISTINCT resource from the REGIONAL ALB ACL created by web-acl-regional-v3.3.1 / envs/*/web-waf
# (the geo/anonymizer/export-control stack, #280/#281/#282) — a REGIONAL ACL ARN cannot be attached to
# a CloudFront distribution (scope mismatch = apply error), so this is not a reuse of that ACL.
#
# PROVIDER: the caller MUST pass an aws provider aliased to us-east-1 (providers = { aws = aws.us-east-1 }).
# The web stacks already declare that alias for their CloudFront ACM certs, so no new provider is needed.
#
# SCOPE OF THIS MODULE: attach a WAF with AWS-managed baseline rule groups (CommonRuleSet +
# KnownBadInputs at minimum) so the public edge has L7 filtering (CKV_AWS_68 / CKV2_AWS_47). It is
# intentionally minimal — the export-control geo/anonymizer rules live on the REGIONAL ALB ACL and are
# NOT duplicated here.
